<h2>Prologue</h2>
<pre>
     You’re standing in a spaceport, ready to board your ship.
Isn’t this what you’ve always dreamed of? Becoming the captain
of a galactic vessel with a crew, ready to embark on heroic missions
under your command.
So let’s go!

<h2>Meeting the Crew</h2>
<pre>
     As you step aboard the ship, you're greeted by a woman holding a black folder:
— Welcome aboard, Captain! I’m Zinaida — your assistant. See over there? In the corner, sipping coffee,
is our navigator — Sergeant Hangover Trail. The guy asleep at the helm is our mechanic — Black Bohdan,
and the one taking pictures is Sergey "Steel-Toe" — our navigator.
And how should we address you?
